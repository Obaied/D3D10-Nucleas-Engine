# D3D10-Nucleas-Engine

Boomerang is a quick demonstration of the Nucleas Engine that is powered by Direct3D 10. Nothing too fancy since this was made purely for educational purposes.

The project is not very organized since this was made just as a proof-of-concept. I didn't find engine development to be something that I liked, but it was a necessary evil to understand the more complex game engines out there.

To play the game, just run the exe file located in "Boomerang\debug\Boomerang.exe".

If you get an error about a missing .dll, then you might have to download DirectX SDK, which can be found on Microsoft website.

If you lose, don't blame it on the game. The exit points were calculated precisely to allow for the player to jump to it perfectly. Every level can be one using only ONE correct jump from ONE correct platform. Try your luck :)

Developing (learning) this engine took me three years. Three years well spent :)
